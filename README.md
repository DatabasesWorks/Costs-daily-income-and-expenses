# Costs - Not an Account Software

Costs is meant to be a simple piece of software to maintain the daily
income/expenses in an easy to use, platform independent way. It uses the QT
toolkit to achieve that and is tested regularly on Linux, OS X and Windows.

The database format is limited to sqlite and so far it is not planed to
extend it to a Client/Server approach as this would spoil the "simple" in
"simple piece of software".

The basic functionality, including CSV import, is there, but the fancy stuff, 
like plots, are still missing. I will try to get rid of the bugs over the next
weeks before starting to work on additional features.
